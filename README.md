Simple sonification of a chart

Using danigb's [soundfont-player.js](https://github.com/danigb/soundfont-player), I've added a simple sonification to Mike Bostock's [x-value-mouseover](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3902569). It's really just about five lines of code, I was amazed how simple this is!
