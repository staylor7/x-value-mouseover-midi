Using danigb's [soundfont-player.js](https://github.com/danigb/soundfont-player), I've added a simple sonification to Mike Bostock's [x-value-mouseover](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3902569). It's just a dozen lines of code. Next I'd like to make a pull-down menu so you can choose different sounds.
